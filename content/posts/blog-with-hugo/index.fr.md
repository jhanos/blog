# How to create your blog with Hugo

Leitmotiv: Focus on writing blog articles (Avoid spending too much time for the perfect design or tool for your website)

## Why Static Site Generator (Hugo)

Static Site Generator are tool like: Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, Zola.

Key points:
- Generate a static website (html/javascript) based on markdown files
- Support templating tool with complex function
- No Maintenance
- Very low attack Risk (instead of wordpress tool for example)
- No complex requirements, only a web server like apache or nginx (i.e.:  no dabatabase, no php) 
- Low resources required
- Easy to switch from one theme to another 

## Hosting

You can host your blog for free on:
- Github Page (with Github action)
- Gitlab Page (with gitlab-ci )

It's also possible to define a custom domain name if you have your own domain.

You can of course choose other paid solution:
- AWS
- GCP
- Self-hosted
- ...

## Install Hugo

{{< admonition note >}}
Hugo recommend `extended version` (with WebP images encoding and Transpile Sass to CSS)
{{< /admonition >}}

[Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) offers a lots of features, sometimes it's confusing but the quickstart is really good.

Hugo is written in GO so you can use directly [release from github](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) or use your package manager 

- [Release for amd64 windows](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.104.3/hugo_0.104.3_windows-amd64.zip)
- [Release for amd64 Linux](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.104.3/hugo_extended_0.104.3_linux-amd64.tar.gz)




## Create your blog

To create your blog stucture, you just need:

```bash
hugo new site myblog
cd myblog
ls
```

This command will creates:
- config.toml: the config file for your blog site
- content: the directory which contains your articles in markdown format
- static: the directory which contains static content (favicon, avatar, ...)
- themes: the directory which contains your theme

For further detail, see [Directory Structure](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/)

## Choose your theme

You can find a lots of theme for hugo in the [official site](https://themes.gohugo.io/)

Choose one and put it in the theme directory.

I choose [loveit theme](https://hugoloveit.com/) for its features:
- Multi language 
- responsive
- Customizable
- Very active
- Beautiful ( <- totally subjective)


To use this theme, execute this:
```bash
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt themes/loveit
echo theme = \"loveit\" >> config.toml
```

{{< admonition note >}}
Git command are optionnal, but i advice to use it to update your theme 
{{< /admonition >}}


## Write your first article

Create your article's file

```bash
hugo new posts/my-first-post/index.en.md
```

Each post contains :
- metadata in order to define title, author, tags and state (publish or not) in the headers 
- your article content

For example, use your favorite editor and add this content in `index.en.md`:
```md
---
title: "My First Post"
date: 2019-03-26T08:47:11+01:00
draft: true
---
My beautiful article

some content 
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. 
Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. 
Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. 
Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
```

## Start the blog in testing mode

Launch Hugo server to see the result:
```bash
hugo server -D
```

You can reach you blog at: [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/).

Each time you modify your article, the website is reload

## Customize your theme

Add options from loveit theme inside your config.toml
```bash
cat themes/loveit/config.toml >> config.toml
```

Modify the `config.toml` in order to customize your blog:
- Website url (`baseURL`)
- Website title (`title` and `params.title` and `params.header.title.name` and `params.app.title`)
- Avatar picture (`params.home.profile.avatarURL`)
- Text below the avatar (`params.home.profile.subtitle`)
- Website description (`params.description`)
- ...

You can also add this block in `config.toml` to add highlight:
```toml
# Markup related configuration in Hugo
[markup]
  # Syntax Highlighting (https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting)
  [markup.highlight]
    codeFences = true
    guessSyntax = true
    lineNos = true
    lineNumbersInTable = true
    # false is a necessary configuration (https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt/issues/158)
    noClasses = false
  # Goldmark is from Hugo 0.60 the default library used for Markdown
  [markup.goldmark]
    [markup.goldmark.extensions]
      definitionList = true
      footnote = true
      linkify = true
      strikethrough = true
      table = true
      taskList = true
      typographer = true
    [markup.goldmark.renderer]
      # whether to use HTML tags directly in the document
      unsafe = true
  # Table Of Contents settings
  [markup.tableOfContents]
    startLevel = 2
    endLevel = 6
```

## Tips and Tricks

### MultiLingual

For multilanguage support, you need:
- define the language in config.toml
```toml
[languages]
  [languages.en]
    languageName = "English"
    weight = 1
    languageCode = "en"
  [languages.fr]
    languageName = "French"
    weight = 2
    languageCode = "fr"
```

- Create articles with the language code:
  - index.en.md for english article
  - index.fr.md for french article

Automatically hugo will detect articles, for example If i create 3 articles in english and french and one article in english only.
The result will be: 
- 4 articles if the language selected is english
- 3 articles if the language selected is french

### Schedule Article

To schedule article, you need to define a publishDate in the future in the front matter:
```md
---
title: "Ansible-rulebook, How to trigger ansible on events"
date: 2022-10-26T11:24:09+02:00
draft: false
author: Jhanos
publishDate: 2023-07-27
---

# My title

My body
```

And in this case, when you generate your site with hugo, if the date is anterior to publishDate the article is not published

{{< admonition note >}}
I need to schedule hugo to take benefit of this feature (crontab, github actions, gitlab-ci ...)

### Self sufficient (GDPR ...)

{{< admonition warning >}}
Why? 
Regarding GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), the usage of cdn seems not recommended (example: [google font api](https://www.theregister.com/2022/01/31/website_fine_google_fonts_gdpr/)).
{{< /admonition >}}

To avoid cdn usage, you can download files used by this theme from cdn with this script):
```bash
# The two next lines are optionnal if you already have yq
curl -o yq "https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/download/v4.30.5/yq_linux_amd64"
chmod u+x yq
mkdir -p assets/data/cdn/
cp theme/loveit/assets/data/cdn/jsdelivr.yml assets/data/cdn/jsdelivr.yml
for file in $(./yq '.libFiles[]' assets/data/cdn/jsdelivr.yml ); do mkdir -p static/cdn/$(dirname $file); curl -Lo static/cdn/$file https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/$file;done;
cp -rp themes/loveit/static/lib/webfonts static/cdn/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free@6.1.1/
```
All dependencies are stored in static/cdn/ and your website is autonomous.

You need to modify the value of `libFiles` by your website (https://www.thonis.fr/cdn/) in `assets/data/cdn/jsdelivr.yml` :
```yaml
‚ùØ cat assets/data/cdn/jsdelivr.yml
prefix:
  libFiles: https://www.thonis.fr/cdn/
  # simple-icons@7.3.0 https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons
  simpleIcons: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simple-icons@7.3.0/icons/
libFiles:
  # fontawesome-free@6.1.1 https://fontawesome.com/
  ...
```

### Analytics

Regarding the previous point, I disable any analytics and i use [goaccess](goaccess.io).  
This tool scan your webserver log and generate a report (html or cli), so the most simple usage is:
```bash
# After this command, you only need to choose your log format
goaccess /var/log/nginx/access.log
``` 

In my case, i want to filter on a specific domain, add geoIP and also to use compressed log so i use:
```bash
(cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/access.log.1 && zcat /var/log/nginx/access.log.*.gz) | grep "www.thonis.fr" | goaccess - --log-format=VCOMBINED -o /home/jhanos/public/report.html --geoip-database=/home/jhanos/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb --anonymize-ip
```
